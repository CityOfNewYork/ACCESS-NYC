## Tech
ACCESS NYC is a publicly available [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site hosted on [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/). Source code is available as in this repository. All benefit program information on ACCESS NYC is publicly available through the [Benefits and Programs API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/2j8u-wtju) on the City of New Yorkâ€™s Open Data portal.

The ACCESS NYC eligibility screener is a single page web application powered by an API built on the [Drools Business Rules Management System](https://www.drools.org/) hosted on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) through the [NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications](http://www.nyc.gov/doitt). The [NYC Benefits Screening API](https://screeningapidocs.cityofnewyork.us) is an open API that allows developers to utilize the rules engine that governs the ACCESS NYC Eligibility Screener.

The [ACCESS NYC Patterns](https://github.com/cityofnewyork/access-nyc-patterns) provide fonts, icons, and JavaScript enhanced components and utilities that support WCAG AA compliance, multi-lingual (right-to-left and left-to-right) layouts, mobile devices and Internet Explorer 11. They are distributed as an NPM Package which can be installed in any project.

## Local Installation

### Requirements
* **Virtualization** (Docker, Virtualbox, or other). This WordPress repository can be run many ways. The product team at NYC Opportunity uses [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) and the [NYCO WP Docker Boilerplate](https://github.com/cityofnewyork/nyco-wp-docker-boilerplate) for running and managing the application locally.

* **Composer**. PHP and WordPress plugin dependencies for WordPress core and the ACCESS NYC Theme are managed via Composer. [Learn more about Composer on it's website](https://getcomposer.org/).

* **Node and NPM**. The ACCESS NYC Theme uses Node with NPM to manage packages such as Gulp to compile assets for the front-end. Learn more about [Node](https://nodejs.org), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) at their respective websites.

### Installation
This won't cover all of the options for standing up a WordPress site given all of the options available but it can be done with [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) and following the instructions in the [NYCO WordPress Docker Boilerplate](https://github.com/cityofnewyork/nyco-wp-docker-boilerplate) readme. *The following instructions assume you have a working environment ready to drop a WordPress site into, including a server and MySQL database*.

**$1** Rename **wp-config-sample.php** to **wp-config.php**. Modify the *MySQL settings*, *Authentication Unique Keys and Salts*, and *WordPress debugging mode*. If using the NYCO WordPress Docker Boilerplate, you can use the [**wp-config.php** included in the repository](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyco-wp-docker-boilerplate/blob/master/wp/wp-config.php) but you should still update the salts.

**$2** To get untracked composer packages when you install the site you will need to run the following in the root of the WordPress site where the [**composer.json**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/composer.json) file lives:

    composer install

**$3** This will install plugins included in the Composer package, including **NYCO WordPress Config** (details below). This plugin includes a sample config which needs to be renamed from **mu-plugins/config/config-sample.yml** to **mu-plugins/config/config.yml**.

## WordPress Site Structure

### Configuration
ACCESS NYC integrates the [NYCO WordPress Config plugin](https://packagist.org/packages/nyco/wp-config) for determining configurations based on environment. This plugin will pull from an array of variables set in the **mu-plugins/config/config.yml** file and set the appropriate group to environment variables that can be accessed by site functions, templates, and plugins.

### ACCESS NYC Theme
The theme for the site contains all of the php functions, templates, styling, and scripts for the site front-end and can be found in the [**themes**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access) directory. This is the only WordPress theme that is compatible with the WordPress site.

#### Twig Templates
The theme is built on [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) which uses the [Twig Templating Engine](https://twig.symfony.com/). Templates can be edited in the [**/views**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access/views) directory.

#### PHP Functions
Some functions are included in the theme's [**functions.php**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/wp-content/themes/access/functions.php), however, new modules are stored in the [**/includes**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access/includes) directory and are included in **functions.php** at the bottom of the file.

#### Assets
The source for image, style, and script files live in the [**src**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access/src) and are compiled to the [**/assets**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access/assets) directory. This is done with NPM Scripts in [**package.json**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/wp-content/themes/access/package.json) and tasks in the [GulpFile](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/wp-content/themes/access/gulpfile.babel.js). The theme relies heaviliy on the [ACCESS NYC Patterns](https://accesspatterns.cityofnewyork.us) for sourcing Stylesheets and JavaScript modules. Refer to the [documentation](https://accesspatterns.cityofnewyork.us) for details on the different patterns and their usage.

### Plugins
WordPress Plugins are managed via Composer and the WordPress Admin. They are tracked by the repository to be easily shipped to different environments. Plugins utilized by the WordPress site can be found in the [**plugins**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/plugins) directory. Key plugins include [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), [WordPress Multilingual](https://wpml.org/), [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/), and the [Gather Content WordPress Integration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gathercontent-import/). There are a few ways of managing plugins.

#### WordPress Admin Plugins
Not all plugins can be managed by Composer. Specifically [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and [WordPress Multilingual](https://wpml.org/). These plugins must be updated by either downloading from their respective sites and adding directly to the **wp-content/plugins** directory or by logging into the *WordPress Admin* and updating via the **/wp-admin/plugins** page.

#### Must Use Plugins
[Must Use Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) are used to handle most of the custom configuration for the WordPress site including custom post types, plugin configuration, and special plugins that enable additional functionality for major features of the site. Those can be found in the [**mu-plugins**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/mu-plugins) directory.

Additional configuration and functions can be found in the ACCESS NYC Theme.

#### Composer Plugins
The [**composer.json**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/composer.json) file illustrates which plugins can be managed by Composer. WordPress Plugins can be installed either from [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/) or from Packagist via the [Composer Libray Installer](https://github.com/composer/installers). Other php packages that are not plugins and stored in the `/vendor` directory are tracked by git so they can be deployed with the code. See the [**.gitignore**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/.gitignore) file under the "Composer" section to see which ones.

Before installing dependencies the development autoloader should be generated. This will include development dependencies in the autoloader:

    composer run development

Then, to update a single plugin run:

    composer update {{ vendor }}/{{ package }}:{{ version }}

For example:

    composer update wpackagist-plugin/acf-to-rest-api:3.1.0

... will update the *ACF to Rest API* plugin to version 3.1.0. Updating plugins individually is recommended when testing for compatibility. **Once you are done developing generate the production autoloader which will remove development dependencies in the autoloader:**

    composer run predeploy

## Using Composer

In addition to WordPress Plugins, Composer is used to manage third party dependencies that some plugins rely on as well as provide developer tools for working with PHP applications. The Composer package comes with scripts that can be run via the command:

    composer run {{ script }}

Script        | Description
--------------|-
`development` | Rebuilds the autoloader including development dependencies.
`production`  | Rebuilds the autoloader omitting development dependencies.
`predeploy`   | Rebuilds the autoloader using the `production` script then runs [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) using the `lint` script (described below).
`lint`        | Runs PHP Code Sniffer which will display violations of the standard defined in the [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/phpcs.xml) file.
`fix`         | Runs PHP Code Sniffer in fix mode which will attempt to fix violations automatically. It is not necessarily recommended to run this on large scripts because if it fails it will leave a script partially formatted and malformed.
`version`     | Regenerates the **composer.lock** file and rebuilds the autoloader for production.
`deps`        | This is a shorthand for `composer show --tree` for illustrating package dependencies.

By default **/vendor** packages are not tracked by the repository. If a composer package is required by production it needs to be included in the repository so it can be deployed to WP Engine. The [**.gitignore**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/.gitignore) manually includes tracked repositories using the `!` prefix. This does not apply to WordPress plugins.

## Using NPM

NPM is used to manage the assets in the ACCESS NYC Theme. To get started with modifying the theme front-end, navigate to the [**/wp-content/themes/access**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/tree/master/wp-content/themes/access) theme in your terminal and and run:

    npm install

This will install all node dependencies in the same directory.

The [**package.json**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/wp-content/themes/access/package.json) contains a proxy configuration that BrowserSync uses to serve from. If the url defined by your virtualization service ([see the requirements section](#requirements)) is different from the default proxy (`http://locahost:8080`), it should be changed to match.

Then run:

    npm run start

To start the development server for asset managment. The NPM package comes scripts which can be run via the command:

    npm run {{ script }}

Script        | Description
--------------|-
`gulp`        | Gulp is included as a dependency so this proxy enables running gulp tasks in the [**gulpfile.babel.js**](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/wp-content/themes/access/gulpfile.babel.js) file if it is not globally installed. Any task in the GulpFile can be run with `npm run gulp {{ task name }}`.
`start`       | This is a proxy script for the `development` script below.
`development` | This runs the default Gulp task in development mode `NODE_ENV=development` which watches and compiles assets. Once it runs, will fire up a [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) server to watch for file changes and reload the proxy set to the package.json `config` object.
`production`  | This runs the default Gulp task in production mode `NODE_ENV=production` which also watches, compiles assets, and creates a BrowserSync server. The main difference is that production mode uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and will enforce JavaScript writing style.
`predeploy`   | This runs a one-off compilation of assets in production mode.
`scripts`     | This runs a one-off compilation of JavaScript assets in production mode.
`styles`      | This runs a one-off compilation of stylesheet assets in production mode.

## Debug Browsing

The query parameter `?debug=1` to the site URL in any environment to help in debugging front-end issues. This will do a number of things. It will serve a non-minified version of the JavaScript with some logging enabled. It will also allow you to jump around to different steps in the eligibility screener, e.g. `/eligiblity?debug=1#step-8`, and if the web inspector is open will pause the app before and after the screener form is submitted while outputting the data payload and response object respectively.

## Coding Style

### PHP
PHP is linted using [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with the [PSR-2 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). The configuration can be found in the [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC/blob/master/phpcs.xml). Linting must be done manually using the command:

    composer run lint

PHP Code Sniffer can attempt to fix violations using `composer run fix` but it is not recommended for multiple files or large scripts as it can fail and leave malformed php files.

### Javascript
The JavaScript is written in ES6 syntax. Source files are located in the theme **/src/js** directory. JavaScript is linted by the `gulp lint` task with the ESLint [Google's standards](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml). It is transpiled, concatenated, and minified by the `gulp scripts` task, using [Webpack Stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stream).

The main JavaScript libraries used are [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

### SCSS
The theme relies heaviliy on the [ACCESS NYC Patterns](https://accesspatterns.cityofnewyork.us) for sourcing Stylesheets. Refer to the [documentation](https://accesspatterns.cityofnewyork.us) for details on the different patterns and their usage. The Pattern SCSS files are processed, concatenated, and minfied by the gulp styles task.
