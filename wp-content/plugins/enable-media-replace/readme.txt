Enables replacing attachment files by simply uploading a new file in the media library edit view.

== Description ==

Don't you find it tedious and complicated to have to first delete a file and then upload one with the exact same name every time you want to update an image or any uploaded file inside the WordPress media library?

Well, no longer!

Now you'll be able to replace any uploaded file from the media "edit" view, where it should be. Media replacement can be done in one of two ways:

1. Just replace the file. This option requires you to upload a file of the same type as the one you are replacing. The name of the attachment will stay the same no matter what the file you upload is called.
1. Replace the file, use new file name and update all links. If you check this option, the name and type of the file you are about to upload will replace the old file. All links pointing to the current file will be updated to point to the new file name.

This plugin is very powerful and a must-have for any larger sites built with WordPress.
