== Changelog ==
= [4.30] 01.12.2016 =
* Update: compatible with WordPress 4.7
* New: "Granted Only" checkbox to the right from the "Quick Filter" input control allows to show only granted capabilities for the selected role or user.

= [4.29] 10.11.2016 =
* New: User Role Editor own user capabilities are grouped separately under Custom capabilities.
* Update: URE_Lib::is_super_admin() uses WordPress core is_super_admin() for multisite setup only. Superadmin is a user with 'administrator' role in the case of single site WordPress installation.  
  This is the difference with the WordPress core which counts as a superadmin (for single site WP installation) any user with a 'delete_users' capability.
* Update: BaseLib::option_selected() calls were replaced with the calls of a similar selected() function from WordPress core.

= [4.28] 20.10.2016 =
* New: WooCommerce plugin user capabilities (if exist) are grouped separately under Custom capabilities.
* Update: Temporally raised permissions flag is taken into account when checking, if user has a superadmin privileges. WordPress is_super_admin() function was replaced with custom wrapper to define if current user is a real superadmin or just a local admin with the temporally raised (add/edit users pages) permissions.

= [4.27.2] 15.09.2016 =
* Update: There was a conflict with plugins which use a '|' character at the custom user capabilities: e.g. 'Nginx Helper | Config' from "Nginx Helper' plugin.
* Fix: PHP notice was removed: Undefined property: URE_Role_View::$multisite in wp-content/plugins/user-role-editor/includes/classes/view.php on line 143
* Fix: WordPress multisite: Settings link under the URE plugin at the plugins list leads to the network admin now, not to the the single site settings page, which does not exist.
* Fix: WordPress multisite: conflict with "Visual Composer" plugin was resolved: single site administrators could now use Visual Composer editor.
* Fix: WordPress multisite: changed role name was not replicated to other sites when user clicked "Update" with "Apply to All Sites" option turned ON.

= [4.27.1] 22.08.2016 =
* Update: There was a conflict with plugins which use a '/' character at the custom user capabilities: e.g. vc_access_rules_backend_editor/disabled_ce_editor from Visual Composer.
* Update: add/delete, escape, validate user capability code extracted from URE_Lib to the separate URE_Capability class

= [4.27] 18.08.2016 =
* New: Total/Granted counters were added to the capabilities groups titles.
* New: "Columns" drop-down menu allows to change capabilities section layout to 1, 2 or 3 columns.
* New: Capabilities section is limited in height and has independent scrollbar.
* Update: User Role Editor page markup was updated to use more available space on page.
* Update: URE_Ajax_Processor class allows to differentiate required user permissions according to action submitted by user.

* Fix: required JavaScript files were not loaded at "Network Admin->Settings->User Role Editor" page.

= [4.26.3] 25.07.2016 =
* Fix: Selecting a sub-group/list of caps does make the ure_select_all_caps checkbox select all within that group, but checking that box when at the "All" top-level group did not work.

= [4.26.1] 14.07.2016 =
* Fix: some bugs, like 'undefined property' notices, etc.

* New: User capabilities were groupd by functionality for more convenience.
* Update: URE_KEY_CAPABILITY constant was changed from 'ure_edit_roles' to 'ure_manage_options'. To make possible for non-admin users access to the User Role Editor without access to the 'administrator' role and users with 'administrator' role.
* Update: User receives full access to User Role Editor under WordPress multisite if he has 'manage_network_plugins' capability instead of 'manager_network_users' as earlier. This allows to give user ability to edit network users without giving him access to the User Role Editor.
* Update: Multisite: use WordPress's global $current_site->blog_id to define main blog ID instead of selecting the 1st one from the sorted list of blogs.
* Update: use WP transients at URE_Lib::_get_post_types() to reduce response time.
* Update: various internal optimizations.

= [4.25.2] 03.05.2016 =

* Enhance: 'Add Capability' button have added capability to the WordPress built-in administrator role by default. It did not work, if 'administrator' role did not exist.
  Now script selects automatically as an admin role a role with the largest quant of capabilities and adds new capability to the selected role.

= [4.22] 15.01.2016 =
* Unused 'add_users' capability was removed from the list of core capabilities as it was removed from WordPress starting from version 4.4

* Self-added "Other Roles" column removed from "Users" list, as WordPress started to show all roles assigned to the user in its own "Role" column.
