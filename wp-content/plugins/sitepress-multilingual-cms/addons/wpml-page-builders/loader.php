/**
 * WPML Page Builders can be installed as a standalone glue plugin,
 * but it also comes packaged with WPML Core.
 *
 * To include it on WPML Core, do as follows:
 * - Include this repository as a Composer dependency.
 * - Wait until plugins_loaded to include this loader.php file.
 *
 * This will ensure that the glue plugin can be used if available;
 * otherwise, this will ensure that the WPML plugin packing the newest version will push it.
 *
 * $wpml_page_builders_version must be increased on every new version of the glue plugin.
 * Also, having a negative priority ensures that the highest version number gets called first.
