# WPML Functional Programming Library

Many functional programming resources can be difficult for beginners to understand. Functional programming isn’t exactly a friendly paradigm for new programmers, and maintenance can be difficult during the coding phase. The switch to functional programming requires time, practice, and a change in the approach to writing code and solving problems.
Although we reviewed many libraries, several of which were excellent, we weren’t able to find what we needed to write expressive code in a functional style - so we decided to create our own.
Take a look at the Functional Programming Library built by our developers to see a collection of functions we’ve used in WPML projects.
