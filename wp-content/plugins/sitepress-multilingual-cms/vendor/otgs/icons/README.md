# OTGS Icons

The fonts are generated by using [Fantasticicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasticon) npm package.

How to update the icons:

1. Upload new SVG icons to "/icons/src/" folder
2. Run npm script "fix-svg-icons" that will fix prepare all SVG images and place them inside "/icons/dest/" folder
3. run npm script "create-otgs-font" to generate new font files

This project also uses [SVG Fixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oslllo-svg-fixer) npm package that attempts to fix SVG files by turning it into a fill / single path (and making it font compatible).
