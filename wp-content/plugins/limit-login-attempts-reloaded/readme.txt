Reloaded version of the original Limit Login Attempts plugin for Login Protection by a team of WordPress developers. GDPR compliant.

== Description ==

Limit the number of login attempts that are possible through the normal login as well as XMLRPC, Woocommerce and custom login pages.

WordPress by default allows unlimited login attempts. This can lead to  passwords being easily cracked via brute-force.

Limit Login Attempts Reloaded blocks an Internet address (IP) from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries has been reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do if all users get blocked? =

If you are using contemporary hosting, it's likely your site uses a proxy domain service like CloudFlare, Sucuri, Nginx, etc. They replace your user's IP address with their own. If the server where your site runs is not configured properly (this happens a lot) all users will get the same IP address. This also applies to bots and hackers. Therefore, locking one user will lead to locking everybody else out. If the plugin is not using our <a href="https://www.limitloginattempts.com/">Cloud App</a>, this can be adjusted using the Trusted IP Origin setting. The cloud service intelligently recognizes the non-standard IP origins and handles them correctly, even if your hosting provider does not.

= What settings should I use In The Plugin? =

The settings are explained within the plugin in great detail. If you are unsure, use the default settings as they are the recommended ones.

= Can I share the allow/deny/pass lists throughout all of my sites?=

By default, you will need to copy and paste the lists to each site manually. For the <a href="https://www.limitloginattempts.com/features/">premium service</a>, sites are grouped within the same private cloud account. Each site within that group can be configured if it shares its lockouts and access lists with other group members. The setting is located in the plugin's interface. The default options are recommended.
