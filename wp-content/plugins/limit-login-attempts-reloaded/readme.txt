Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 5.2.1
Stable tag: 2.9.0

Reloaded version of the original Limit Login Attempts plugin for Login Protection by a team of WordPress developers. GDPR compliant.

== Description ==

Limit the number of login attempts that possible both through the normal login as well as using the auth cookies.
WordPress by default allows unlimited login attempts either through the login page or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords (or hashes) to be cracked via brute-force relatively easily.
Limit Login Attempts Reloaded blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries has been reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

Features:

* Limit the number of retry attempts when logging in (per each IP). This is fully customizable.
* Limit the number of attempts to log in using authorization cookies in the same way.
* Informs the user about the remaining retries or lockout time on the login page.
* Optional logging and optional email notification.
* It is possible to whitelist/blacklist IPs and Usernames.
* Sucuri Website Firewall compatibility.
* **XMLRPC** gateway protection.
* **Woocommerce** login page protection.
* **Multi-site** compatibility with extra MU settings.
* **GDPR** compliant. With this feature turned on, all logged IPs get obfuscated (md5-hashed).
* **Custom IP origins** support (Cloudflare, Sucuri, etc.)

* The plugin doesn't trust any IP addresses other than _SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] anymore. Trusting other IP origins make protection useless b/c they can be easily faked.

= 2.7.3 =
* Settings page is moved back to "Settings".

= 2.7.2 =
