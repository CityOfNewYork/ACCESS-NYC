== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I set the limit, and where? 🤔 =

This plugin does not have a seperate settings page. But we have one configural settings to let you set the login limit.

1. Go to `Settings` page in admin dashboard.
2. Scroll down to see the section `🔐 Loggedin`.
3. Set the maximum number of active logins a user can have in `Maximum Active Logins` option.

= Can I somehow allow new logins when the limit is reached? 🤔 =

You can forcefully logout the user from other devices and allow new login.

1. Go to `Settings` page in admin dashboard.
2. Scroll down to see the section `🔐 Loggedin`.
3. Select the `Login Logic` as `Allow`.

= Can I block the new logins when the limit is reached? 🤔 =

You block the new logins when the user is logged in from maximum no. of devices according to the limit you set.

1. Go to `Settings` page in admin dashboard.
2. Scroll down to see the section `🔐 Loggedin`.
3. Select the `Login Logic` as `Block`.
4. Now user will have to wait for the other login sessions to expire before login from new device.

= How long a login session exist? How long the user needs to wait for new login? 🤔 =

That depends. If the “Remember Me” box is checked while login, WordPress will keep the user logged in for 14 days by default. If “Remember Me” is not checked, 2 days will be the active login session time.

You can change that period using, auth_cookie_expiration filter.

<pre lang="php">
function loggedin_auth_cookie_expiration( $expire ) {
    // Allow for a month.
    return MONTH_IN_SECONDS;
}

add_filter( 'auth_cookie_expiration', 'loggedin_auth_cookie_expiration' );
</pre>

= How can I forcefully logout a user from all devices? 🤔 =

You can forcefully logout a user from all the devices he has logged into. Get his WordPress user ID and,

1. Go to `Settings` page in admin dashboard.
2. Scroll down to see the section `🔐 Loggedin`.
3. Enter user ID of the user you would like to logout.
4. Click `Force Logout`.

= Can I bypass this limit for certain users or roles? 🤔 =

Yes, of course. But this time you are going to add few lines of code. Don't worry. Just copy+paste this code in your theme's `functions.php` file or in custom plugin:

<pre lang="php">
function loggedin_bypass_users( $bypass, $user_id ) {
    
    // Enter the user IDs to bypass.
    $allowed_users = array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );

    return in_array( $user_id, $allowed_users );
}

add_filter( 'loggedin_bypass', 'loggedin_bypass_users', 10, 2 );
</pre>

Or if you want to bypass this for certain roles:

<pre lang="php">
function loggedin_bypass_roles( $prevent, $user_id ) {

    // Array of roles to bypass.
    $allowed_roles = array( 'administrator', 'editor' );

    $user = get_user_by( 'id', $user_id );

    $roles = ! empty( $user->roles ) ? $user->roles : array();

    return ! empty( array_intersect( $roles, $whitelist ) );
}

add_filter( 'loggedin_bypass', 'loggedin_bypass_roles', 10, 2 );
</pre>
