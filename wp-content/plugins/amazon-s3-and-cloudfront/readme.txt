Contributors: bradt, deliciousbrains
Tags: uploads, amazon, s3, amazon s3, mirror, admin, media, cdn, cloudfront
Requires at least: 4.4
Tested up to: 4.6.1
Stable tag: 1.1.3
License: GPLv3

Copies files to Amazon S3 as they are uploaded to the Media Library. Optionally configure Amazon CloudFront for faster delivery.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PVybEGaRXc

This plugin automatically copies images, videos, documents, and any other media added through WordPress' media uploader to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). It then automatically replaces the URL to each media file with their respective Amazon S3 URL or, if you have configured [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), the respective CloudFront URL. Image thumbnails are also copied to Amazon S3 and delivered through S3/CloudFront.

Uploading files *directly* to your Amazon S3 account is not currently supported by this plugin. They are uploaded to your server first, then copied to Amazon S3. There is an option to automatically remove the files from your server once they are copied to Amazon S3 however.

If you're adding this plugin to a site that's been around for a while, your existing media files will not be copied or served from Amazon S3. Only newly uploaded files will be copied and served from Amazon S3. The pro upgrade has an upload tool to handle existing media files.
