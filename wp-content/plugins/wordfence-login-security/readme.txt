Are you looking for comprehensive WordPress Security? [Check out the full Wordfence plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/).

#### TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

* Two-factor authentication (2FA), one of the most secure forms of remote system authentication available.
* Use any TOTP-based authenticator app or service like Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password or FreeOTP.
* Enable 2FA for any WordPress user role.
* Completely free to use, no limits or restrictions of any kind.

#### LOGIN PAGE CAPTCHA

* Easily enable Google ReCAPTCHA v3 on your login and registration pages.
* Stops bots from logging in without inconveniencing your site visitors.
* Robust protection against password guessing and credential stuffing attacks distributed across large IP pools

#### XML-RPC PROTECTION

* XML-RPC is the biggest target for WordPress attacks, but is often overlooked.
* Protect XML-RPC with 2FA or disable it altogether if itâ€™s not needed.

== Installation ==

Secure your website using the following steps to install Wordfence:

1. Install Wordfence Login Security automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. 
2. Activate the Wordfence Login Security through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Wordfence Login Security is now activated.
3. Go to the 'Login Security' menu and activate two-factor authentication and configure other settings.

To install Wordfence Login Security on WordPress Multisite installations:

1. Install Wordfence Login Security via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
2. Network Activate Wordfence Login Security. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their 'Plugins' menu. Once activated, that option disappears. 
3. Now that Wordfence Login Security is network activated, it will appear on your Network Admin menu for super administrators and individual sites for users who have permission to activate 2FA. 

== Screenshots ==

Secure your website with Wordfence Login Security. 

1. Take login security to the next level with two-factor authentication.
2. Logging in is easy with Wordfence 2FA.
3. Configuration options include XML-RPC protection and login page CAPTCHA.
