Quickly transfer structured content to and from your GatherContent projects and your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Installing our WordPress plugin on your site allows you to quickly perform updates of your content from your GatherContent account to WordPress as well as push your WordPress content updates back to GatherContent. Content can be imported as new pages/posts or custom post types, and you can also import your WordPress content back to new GatherContent items.

The plugin allows you to map each field in your GatherContent Templates with WordPress fields. This is accomplished by creating a Template Mapping, which allows you to map each field in GatherContent to various fields in WordPress; title, body content, custom fields, tags, categories, Yoast fields, advanced custom fields, featured images â€¦ and many more.

The module currently supports the following features:

* Import content from GatherContent
* Export content to GatherContent
* Update content in Wordpress from GatherContent
* Update content from Wordpress to GatherContent

For additional developer documentation, please [review the wiki](https://github.com/gathercontent/wordpress-plugin/wiki).

### What is GatherContent?

GatherContent is an online platform for pulling together, editing, and reviewing website content with your clients and colleagues. It's a reliable alternative to emailing around Word documents and pasting content into your CMS. This plugin replaces that process of copying and pasting content and allows you to bulk import structured content, and then continue to update it in WordPress with a few clicks.

Connecting a powerful content production platform, to a powerful content publishing platform.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `gathercontent-import` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the GatherContent plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the menu item "GatherContent"
4. Link your accounts. You will need to enter your GatherContent account URL (e.g. http://mywebsite.gathercontent.com) and your personal GatherContent API key. You can find your API key in your [Settings area within GatherContent](https://gathercontent.com/developers/authentication/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Support page? =
* Under the GatherContent menu item, you will see a Support page. On this page, you'll find a large textarea filled with technical information about your server, browser, plugin, etc. This information is very useful when debugging, and the GatherContent support team may ask you for it at some point.

Below the text box is a button that will allow you to simply save all of that information to a .txt file. This allows you to easily deliver it to anyone who needs it.

**Note:** This information contains potentially senstive data. Please be careful with where you post it. Do not post it in the WordPress support forums.

= If you need help =
* Please [visit our support documentation](https://gathercontent.com/support/wordpress-integration).

3. Map individual fields to a huge range of places in WordPress.
4. Quickly find your items by entering the bulk-edit view, and using filters and live search.
5. Using the post metabox, you can push and pull your GatherContent items, and change their status on GatherContent.
6. Or change the item's GatherContent status in quick-edit mode.
