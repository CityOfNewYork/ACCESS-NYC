Quickly transfer structured content to and from your Content Workflow projects and your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Installing our WordPress plugin on your site allows you to quickly perform updates of your content from your Content Workflow account to WordPress as well as push your WordPress content updates back to Content Workflow. Content can be imported as new pages/posts or custom post types, and you can also import your WordPress content back to new Content Workflow items.

The plugin allows you to map each field in your Content Workflow Templates with WordPress fields. This is accomplished by creating a Template Mapping, which allows you to map each field in Content Workflow to various fields in WordPress; title, body content, custom fields, tags, categories, Yoast fields, advanced custom fields, featured images â€¦ and many more.

The module currently supports the following features:

* Import content from Content Workflow
* Export content to Content Workflow
* Update content in Wordpress from Content Workflow
* Update content from Wordpress to Content Workflow

### What is Content Workflow?

Content Workflow is an online platform for pulling together, editing, and reviewing website content with your clients and colleagues. It's a reliable alternative to emailing around Word documents and pasting content into your CMS. This plugin replaces that process of copying and pasting content and allows you to bulk import structured content, and then continue to update it in WordPress with a few clicks.

Connecting a powerful content production platform, to a powerful content publishing platform.
