# Content Workflow (by Bynder) - Version 1.0.5 #

This plugin allows you to transfer content from your Content Workflow projects into your WordPress site and vice-versa.

## Description ##

Installing our WordPress plugin on your site allows you to quickly perform updates of your content from your Content
Workflow account to WordPress as well as push your WordPress content updates back to Content Workflow. Content can be
imported as new pages/posts or custom post types, and you can also import your WordPress content back to new Content
Workflow items.

The plugin allows you to map each field in your Content Workflow Templates with WordPress fields. This is accomplished
by creating a Template Mapping, which allows you to map each field in Content Workflow to various fields in WordPress;
title, body content, custom fields, tags, categories, Yoast fields, advanced custom fields, featured images â€¦ and many
more.

The module currently supports the following features:

* Import content from Content Workflow
* Export content to Content Workflow
* Update content in Wordpress from Content Workflow
* Update content from Wordpress to Content Workflow

### What is Content Workflow?

Content Workflow is an online platform for pulling together, editing, and reviewing website content with your clients
and colleagues. It's a reliable alternative to emailing around Word documents and pasting content into your CMS. This
plugin replaces that process of copying and pasting content and allows you to bulk import structured content, and then
continue to update it in WordPress with a few clicks.

Connecting a powerful content production platform, to a powerful content publishing platform.

Also note, in your WordPress dashboard, under the Content Workflow menu item, you will see a Support page. On this page,

you to easily deliver it to anyone who needs it.

**However**, this information contains potentially senstive data. Please be careful with where you post it. Do not post
it in the WordPress support forums.

# Local Development
If you're running a WordPress instance locally via [Docker Base](https://github.com/Bynder/gathercontent-docker-base),
this repo will be mounted into the plugins directory, meaning any changes you make can be seen instantly.

Along with that, the entire WordPress installation will be mapped to a `wp-data` directory in this repo, from here you
can easily make changes.

## Logging
To enable logging, simply go to `/wp-data/wp-config.php` and add the following:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
@ini_set('display_errors', 0);
```

This will allow critical errors to be logged, and will be viewable at `/wp-data/wp-content/debug.log`.

If you're using this plugins [logging](includes/classes/debug.php), you will find the logs at
`/wp-data/wp-content/gathercontent-debug.log`.

## Adding new plugins
If you need to add a new plugin locally, you'll often run into PHP upload limits which are a pain to adjust. Instead,
you can simply download the plugin, unzip it, and move it into the plugins directory at `/wp-data/wp-content/plugins`.
From there, you can activate the plugin with WordPress.
