Helps you create themes faster with sustainable code. With Timber, you write HTML using Twig Templates http://www.upstatement.com/timber/

== Description ==
Timber helps you create fully-customized WordPress themes faster with more sustainable code. With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) separate from your PHP files. This cleans up your theme code so, for example, your PHP file can focus on being the data/logic, while your Twig file can focus 100% on the HTML and display.

Once Timber is installed and activated in your plugin directory, it gives any WordPress theme the ability to take advantage of the power of Twig and other Timber features.

= 1.6.0 =
**Changes for Theme Developers**

- Enabled methods for getting media from posts, you can now do `{{ post.video }}`, `{{ post.audio }}` and `{{ post.gallery }}` to retrieve media include in the body of a post #1583 (thanks @marciojc)
- You can now get ACF's field object data: `{{ post.field_object('my_field').key }}` #1597 #1599 (thanks @palmiak)
- You can use the `|filter` filter on arrays to return items like so:
```
{% for post in posts|filter('my-slug') %}
    {{ post.title }}
{% endfor %}
```
by default it looks for slugs, but you can also get into particular fields:
```
{% for post in posts|filter({post_title: "Cheese", post_content:"Method Man"}) %}
    {{ post.title }}
{% endfor %}
```
... this will return posts that match both parameters. #1594 thanks @pablo-sg-pacheco

== Screenshots ==

1. This what a normal WordPress PHP file looks like
2. With Timber, you write Twig files that are super-clear and HTML-centric.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. For an example, try modifying your home.php or index.php with something like this:

```
$context = array();
$context['message'] = 'Hello Timber!';
Timber::render( 'welcome.twig', $context );
```

Then create a subdirectory called `views` in your theme folder. Then create a file `views/welcome.twig` with these contents:

```
<div class="welcome">
    <h3>{{ message }}</h3>
</div>
```

That’s Timber!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can it be used in an existing theme? =
You bet! Watch these **[Video Tutorials](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/video-tutorials/)** to see how.

= Is it used in production? =
Tens of thousands of sites now use Timber. You can check some of them out in the **[Showcase](http://upstatement.com/timber/#showcase)**.

= Doesn't this all make WordPress harder since there’s more to learn? =
Does jQuery make JavaScript harder? Yes, it’s an extra piece to learn — but it super-charges your ability to write unencumbered JavaScript (and prevents you from having to learn lots of the messy internals). If your answer is "jQuery sucks and everyone should learn how to write vanilla JavaScript or they’re rotten stupid people," this tool isn’t for you.

= Oh, Timber is simple code so it’s for making simple themes =
Whatever. It simplifies the silly stuff so that you can focus on building more complicated sites and apps. jQuery simplifies Javascript, but you can still use the full range of JavaScript’s abilities.

= Will you support it? =
At [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com) we’re using it in dozens of sites (and many more planned) -- thousands of other developers are using it too. This isn’t going anywhere. Twig is the chosen language for other PHP platforms like Symfony, Drupal 8 and Craft.
