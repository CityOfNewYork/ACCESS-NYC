You can set your own locations for your twig files with...

```php
<?php
Timber::$locations = '/Users/jared/Sandbox/templates';
```

Use the full file path to make sure Timber knows what you're trying to draw from. You can also send an array for multiple locations:

```php
<?php
Timber::$locations = array(
    '/Users/jared/Sandbox/templates',
    '~/Sites/timber-templates/',
    ABSPATH.'/wp-content/templates'
);
```

You only need to do this once in your project (in `functions.php` of your theme). When you call one of the render or compile functions from a PHP file (say `single.php`), Timber will look for Twig files in these locations before it checks the child or parent theme.

## Changing the default folder for Twig files

By default, Timber looks in your child and parent themeâ€™s `views` directory to pull `.twig` files. If you don't like the default `views` directory (which by default resides in your theme folder), you can change that.

Example: If I want to use `/wp-content/themes/my-theme/twigs` as my default folder, I can either configure it with a string or use an array with fallbacks.

### Configure with a string

```php
<?php
Timber::$dirname = 'twigs';
```

### Use an array with fallbacks

This is an alternative to configuring `$dirnames` with a string.

```php
<?php
Timber::$dirname = array( 'templates', 'templates/shared/mods', 'twigs', 'views' );
```

## Subdirectories

You can always reference **subdirectories** in your template folders relatively. For example:

```php
<?php
Timber::render( 'shared/headers/header-home.twig' );
```
... might correspond to a file in  
`/wp-content/themes/my-theme/views/shared/headers/header-home.twig`.
